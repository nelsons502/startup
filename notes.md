# Notes
*Description*: These are my notes about what I have learned in CS260.

I learned that I can use `git pull` to ensure I have the updated version of my work on this machine. I can then work on a small part of my startup, and once I have it working, I should `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to save the changes I made to my repository. 

Each time I do this, the whole project gets saved. This means I can go back to any previous version of my project, which is useful in a wide variety of situations.

my github repo url is: https://github.com/nelsons502/startup.git

I didn't use the template from the course, but I think the way I created my own repo is acceptable.

I just worked on getting the Caddy and HTTPS system up and running. I learned that Caddy is an awesome tool that lets requests to my site be routed correctly in the ways I want them to. 

I also learned that one of the really cool things about the internet is that secure connections and certificates only became easy to acquire in the last decade or so. It's amazing how technology has the ability to change the world! I'm glad that I, as a student can learn about these amazing technologies and put them to use in something I want to build.

I'm having trouble getting the https versions of my site up and running... Hopefully, I'll be able to talk with Dr. Jensen about what might be going wrong when I meet with him in a few minutes.

I have gotten very behind in the class, but I am determined to catch up. I plan to spend 8-10 hours a week on this class for the rest of the semester, or until I have everything completed. I'm not willing to take the class again when I can get it done NOW!

**Update**: Dr. Jensen was encouraging but told me that I would definitely need to invest a ***LOT*** of time into the class in order to pass. I'm willing to do so, I just need to put the time in and communicate with the TA's whenever I get stuck on something.
