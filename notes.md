# Notes
*Description*: These are my notes about what I have learned in CS260.

I learned that I can use `git pull` to ensure I have the updated version of my work on this machine. I can then work on a small part of my startup, and once I have it working, I should `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to save the changes I made to my repository. 

Each time I do this, the whole project gets saved. This means I can go back to any previous version of my project, which is useful in a wide variety of situations.

my github repo url is: https://github.com/nelsons502/startup.git

I didn't use the template from the course, but I think the way I created my own repo is acceptable.

I just worked on getting the Caddy and HTTPS system up and running. I learned that Caddy is an awesome tool that lets requests to my site be routed correctly in the ways I want them to. 

I also learned that one of the really cool things about the internet is that secure connections and certificates only became easy to acquire in the last decade or so. It's amazing how technology has the ability to change the world! I'm glad that I, as a student can learn about these amazing technologies and put them to use in something I want to build.

I'm having trouble getting the https versions of my site up and running... Hopefully, I'll be able to talk with Dr. Jensen about what might be going wrong when I meet with him in a few minutes.

I have gotten very behind in the class, but I am determined to catch up. I plan to spend 8-10 hours a week on this class for the rest of the semester, or until I have everything completed. I'm not willing to take the class again when I can get it done NOW!

**Update**: Dr. Jensen was encouraging but told me that I would definitely need to invest a ***LOT*** of time into the class in order to pass. I'm willing to do so, I just need to put the time in and communicate with the TA's whenever I get stuck on something.

## HTML deliverable
In working with HTML, I have come to appreciate the importance of good DOM design. It will either make or break your web application to have the page laid out in a good format. In order for the CSS, JS and other technologies to work well with the page, everything needs to be neat and intuitive, as this will make it much easier to modify the DOM over time.

I uploaded the Simon HTML to my website. I learned that we need to put the the code all together in a good structure and that the navigation is a huge part of the web app. I also learned that putting the DOCUTYPE twice in the HTML can mess up what gets shown on the page.

Added the Simon CSS a few days ago. CSS really was a game changer for the internet! It makes all the difference on how a website feels and looks. I decided to change my CSS to "dark-mode" so that it would be easier on my eyes throughout this project. I wonder how hard it is to toggle back and forth between light and dark mode. I image there would just be two different `styles.css` files that get selected based on whether dark mode is enabled or not. Pretty cool!

I decided not to use any frameworks since I have some experience with them already from teaching basic Web Dev to kids over Zoom. I wanted to have more control over what everything looked like, although my buttons took after Bootstrap I think.

I learned about React and Vite. These are really cool tools that do so much work for me! As I use them, I'm worried about breaking the system apart with too much tinkering. I'm really glad I have git to handle version control for me so that I can't mess things up too badly! Web Dev is one of the most community-involved areas of coding that I have explored yet! I wonder if I will make a great contribution to some aspect of CS someday like Jordan Walke did. 

I had a lot of fun putting together the first half of the React! It was very straightforward and I felt quite accomplished after. I showed it to my wife and she likes it so far! I feel like this could becomem something that I actually use and make money from granting people access to! It would be a value-adding part of the company I want to start.

Just deployed Simon React (part 2) to my site. I have learned about JavaScript and love how dynamic the language is! In a lot of ways, it reminds me of Python (untyped with dynamic objects, arrays and other features). I can definitely appreaciate the clever ways it goes about using `Promises`, `async` and `await` to make the best use out of single-threaded processors. I think my website uses those features pretty well, and I am excited to finish up the JS for it and deploy later today!
