# Notes
*Description*: These are my notes about what I have learned in CS260.

I learned that I can use `git pull` to ensure I have the updated version of my work on this machine. I can then work on a small part of my startup, and once I have it working, I should `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to save the changes I made to my repository. 

Each time I do this, the whole project gets saved. This means I can go back to any previous version of my project, which is useful in a wide variety of situations.

my github repo url is: https://github.com/nelsons502/startup.git

I didn't use the template from the course, but I think the way I created my own repo is acceptable.
